## 🆘 Still Not Working?

If you still have issues:

1. **Check yt-dlp is installed:**

   ```bash
   yt-dlp --get-url "https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8h0vErv2-y/"
   ```
   
   This should print a video URL.

3. **Share the exact error** you're seeing

4. **Check Python version:**
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   
   Should be 3.8 or higher.
